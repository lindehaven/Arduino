# ARDUINO

## Background

Got myself an Arduino Uno to tinker with. A small one-board computer that is
easy to develop hardware and software for. I like that. Here are my projects.

## Clock

Displays date, day of week, ISO week number, time and timer. Date, time, timer
and clock drift adjustment can be set using the buttons on the LCD shield or
via the serial interface.

See details in `Clock/README.md`.
