# ARDUINO

## Background

Got myself an Arduino Uno to tinker with. A small one-board computer that is
easy to develop hardware and software for. I like that. Here are my projects.

## Clock

Displays date, day of week, ISO week number, time and timer. Date, time and
timer can be set using the buttons on the LCD shield. The timer is stored as a
preset timer so that it can be restarted with a single click of a button. The
LCD screen blinks for 10 seconds before the timer expires. Any clock drift can
be eliminated with microsecond resolution adjustment.

See `Clock/README.md`.
